# Milestones

## External
Trello
- each feature is stored on trello for managing state (working on, completed, bug)

## Semantics
Major.Minor.Patch

- Major represents a large change in how the game plays. These will only be incremented where the game feels foreign to the last Major release.
- Minor represents a collection of small changes that were deemed enough to call a release.
- Patch represents a small change that is significant on it's own but not even for a full minor
