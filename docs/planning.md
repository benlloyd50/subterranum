# WIP Roguelike

- needs a name

## Setting
- less fantasy based, i always go this route
- maybe a city that is always nighttime? ; this needs to be more than just zombies
- managing a space station
- pirates on the ocean? ; just sounds cool honestly
- merchant where selling > killing monsters ; being a middleman between sellers sounds boring
- gathering where collecting resources is an integral part ; gathering is always needed

## Gameplay Loop


## Mechanics Breakdown
